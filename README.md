### About Me

I'm a year 11 student taking Digital Technology at western springs. For sport I do Brazillian JiuJitsu, and in my spare time I enjoy playing video games, board games, going fishing and playing with my cat. My favourite food is probably [Krabby's Crab Boil in Australia](https://www.krabbyscrabboil.com.au/)

<h3> Reason for study </h3>
 <p>I want to study <b> Digital Technology </b> because I'm interested in the subject, and want to learn how to code and 3D model as I think these will be useful skills, and I also enjoy doing these things.</p>
 <h3> Languages </h3>
<p> The Digital languages I know how to use are: HTML and CSS, these are the languages I used in my websites and my first coding projects. </p>
<h3> Aspirations </h3>
Somethings which I would like to accomplish in Digital Technology are 3D modelling something mechanical, with moving parts, and creating a website I am proud of.
